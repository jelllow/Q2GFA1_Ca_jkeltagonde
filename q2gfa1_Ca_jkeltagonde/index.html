            Pet stores and breeders selling live animals are major players in an uncaring and deadly industry. 
            Treated like disposable merchandise, millions of animals—including cats—are born into the pet trade 
            every year. They’re frequently passed off to almost any human willing to pay for them, and the 
            animals often suffer and die. There’s no such thing as responsible breeding, and if someone is 
            profiting from the sale of an animal, you can bet that the animal’s well-being is not the top priority.
